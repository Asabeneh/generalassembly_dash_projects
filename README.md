## General Assemb.ly Dash Tutorial Projects

Projects from https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects.

Done 20140629. 

 1. Build a personal website.
   2. Initial site: Anna's Website. 
 1. Build a responsive blog theme.
   2. Initial site: Jeff's Blog.
 1. Build a small business website.
   2. Initial site: Esha's Restaurant. 
 1. Build a CSS robot. "Eccentric millionaire Cotter Patrick needs a life-like companion."
 1. Build a Madlibs game.

### Problems

 * In Esha's Restaurant, the descriptions appear before being clicked; this did not happen on the Dash site.
 * In the CSS robot, "laser eyes" in this project do not work in Firefox, either here or on the Dash site. In Chrome we get only a single red eye, not two eyes.
